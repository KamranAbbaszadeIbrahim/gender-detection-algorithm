== Model DTO Classes

For implementation of gender detection algorithms three model classes were designed

RequestDto
|===
| Modifier and Type | Field and Description

| String
| `name` - Used to hold name for further evaluation through algorithms of gender detection
|===

ResourceDto
|===
| Modifier and Type | Field and Description

| List<String>
| `listOfMaleNames` - Used to keep list of male names

| List<String>
| `listOfFemaleNames` - Used to keep list of female names
|===

ResponseDto
|===
| Modifier and Type | Field and Description

| String
| `firstAlgorithmResult` - Used to keep results of analysing name using first algorithm, when only first token is checked

| String
| `secondAlgorithmResult` - Used to keep results of analysing name using second algorithm, when all token are checked. 
If frequency of male name`s occurance is more than for female names, then result is Male, oppositly - Female. In case of equal frequency - INCONCLUSIVE
